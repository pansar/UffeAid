Keep snafu in touch with the world

Since his employer has blocked all ports except 80, the little guy needed some way to stay in touch. 

Extremly crude script to display irc conversation on web page with hilight for the man in questioni with the addition of a gtalk message containing hilighted lines.
The reverse script send the last line on snafus gtalk conversation to irc if it contains the correct hastag

Software needed: ii (http://tools.suckless.org/ii/), connected to bitlbee (http://www.bitlbee.org/). Inotify-tools (should be in your repo)
